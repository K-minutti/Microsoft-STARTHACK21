# START Hack 2021 - Microsoft Case

### Case Introduction
Patients are often confronted with a lot of medical information. 
Aside from the sheer amount of information available online, the specific **«medical jargon»** is often confusing and discouraging, even sometimes for those trained in medical professions.


Just imagine you are a patient that just got a severe medical diagnosis.
Talking to your doctor for a few minutes leaves you with more open questions than answers. 
Browsing the internet for hours is overwhelming, and it's hard to assess quickly which information is actually **relevant** and **trustworthy**.

And even if you know that - reading a medical report or a  research paper can be very discouraging if you can't easily **understand** the key points of it. 





 
**We're looking for innovative, state-of-the-art contributions  to make medical texts easier to understand for patients.**


Some ideas:

* Use NLP and machine learning services to extract, parse & analyze medical texts in high quality across different medical domains, languages and document types.
* Build intuitive, personalized user experiences that empower patients to understand complicated concepts and «medical jargon» 
* Provide relevant context and a "trust score" for documents that a patient found online
* Automatic summarization, (visual) storytelling and illustration of concepts and key statements found in a particular medical document.


Although not necessary, please have a look at our existing prototype, http://summed.org - your solution could build upn it, add some new ideas or go a totally different route - your choice !

### Deep Dive Slides
The deep dive will be a walk through of our existing portotype code 
and some Q&A around how to get started and what we'll look for in detail.

### Further Information
This case is a continuation of a project we started during another hackathon.
Although it's not required, it would be great if we could somehow see how your contribution could be used to take this to the next level:

### Judging Criteria
We're looking for submissions that show potential to **empower patients** to better understand medical information.

Some additional criteria we will look at:
- **Creativity** and "novelty" of the solution
- **Trainability** e.g. can we easily improve the models as we get access to additional training documents (like anonymized MRI reports etc.)
- **Technical feasibility and efficiency** e.g. "simple webapp + fast ML model" is better than "requires a 100x GPU cluster to run"
- **User Experience** / UX (if you build something with an UI)
- **Input Languages** supported (bonus points for supporting e.g. German/French, as many language models are english only)
- Use **Azure services** (where it makes sense - not required) ;-) 
- Use stable, well supported **Open Source** libraries and  tech stack
- **State of the art** algorithms and (language) models. (but see the point for "efficiency" - 0.5% more accuracy is not worth spinning up 10 more servers) 

... and your pitch of course :D
